## Project Description
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game in Python. The primary aim of this project is to demonstrate the application of basic Python concepts such as classes, functions, and control structures. Throughout the development process, I learned about structuring Python programs, handling user input, and managing the game's state.

## Installation
To run this Hangman game, you need to have Python installed on your system. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ssharples/Hangman637
   ```
2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```
   cd Hangman637
   ```

## Usage
To play the game, run the Python script from your command line:

```
python milestone5.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to guess letters. The game continues until you successfully guess the word or run out of lives.
